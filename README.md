PhotographyWebsite
==================

Hi, you're looking at the source of my photography website. 

It has been 'hacked' together using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/), an excellent HTML5 presentation framework by [Hakim El Hattab](http://hakim.se/).

The website can be viewed at http://marcduiker.github.io/PhotographyWebsite/ or http://www.marcduiker.nl. 

Cheers,
